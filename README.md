## Literature Review

I am crafting a comprehensive literature review focusing on the **Evolution of Large Language Models**. The review explores key advancements like the **Transformer architecture**, **self-attention mechanisms**, **CoT prompting**, **ICL**, and **Zero/Few-shot prompting**, along with benchmark comparisons of state-of-the-art models. This process has enriched my understanding of modern NLP, with the review currently under evaluation.
